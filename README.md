This is a console-based implementation of Pac-Man in C, focusing on core mechanics like movement, score tracking, and collision detection. It features Pac-Man (or Cursor) as the player-controlled element navigating through a maze filled with walls, points (eatables), and demons.

Key Functions:

move(): Facilitates Pac-Man movement in all directions.
draw(): Renders the game board on the console.
initialize(): Sets up the game board with walls, demons, and eatables.


The game dynamics involve Pac-Man collecting points while avoiding demons. As Pac-Man consumes points, the number of demons increases, heightening the challenge. This implementation offers a simplified version of the classic Pac-Man experience, showcasing fundamental gameplay elements in a console environment.
