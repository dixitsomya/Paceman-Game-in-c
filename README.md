Pacman or Cursor: The Cursor is the main element that is not static in the whole game
Walls: Walls are the same as real walls we canâ€™t move surpassing them.
Food or Points: These are the elements that need to be collected and added to the main score.
Demons: These are the entities that need to be avoided in the game.
